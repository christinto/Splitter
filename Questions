Questions about Splitter Contract: 

Question 1
When to use Structs[] versus mapping? What is more efficient when working on the blockchain? 
I know you can specify structs to save in memory, but is there a way to save mapping as well...or? 
Indexing variables from both seem to use the same amount of gas (at least in this case). And can you rewrite over a struct? Looks like you
can for balances but I don't know how to rewrite over elements of struct so that it can show updated values...(I know the way it's written
now that I am just adding additional elements to the struct, not overwriting any old ones.)

Question 2
The kill switch...it says that "Even if a contractâ€™s code does not contain a call to selfdestruct, it can still perform that 
operation using delegatecall or callcode." Can you use "delegatecall" or "callcode" to use selfdestruct to send the funds back to the owner
as well? Is there any way someone could hack a contract to selfdestruct and send funds to a wrong address?
